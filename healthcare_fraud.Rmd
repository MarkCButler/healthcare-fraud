# Summary

Exploratory data analysis of a healthcare-fraud
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis)
from Kaggle is presented.

Section 2 describes how clues in the dataset yield informed guesses about its
scope.  Terminology and data integrity are also discussed.

The exploratory analysis presented in Sec. 3 has two goals:

  - Provide general insight into the healthcare market represented by the
    dataset
  - Reveal associations involving the "potential fraud" label for healthcare
    providers in the training dataset

A summary of fraud associations is presented in Sec. 4.

# Dataset {.tabset}

## Description {.unnumbered}

The dataset contains training data and test data, each with four csv files.

The training data was used for the analysis.  Details of the csv files:

  - Inpatient visits to a hospital (30 columns, <nobr>~ 40,000</nobr> rows)
  - Outpatient visits to a hospital (27 columns, <nobr>~ 520,000</nobr> rows)
  - The patients who made these hospital visits (25 columns, <nobr>~ 140,000</nobr>
    rows)
  - The hospitals visited, referred to as providers (2 columns:  provider ID
    and PotentialFraud label, <nobr>~ 5,400</nobr> rows)

The patients in the dataset appear to be Medicare patients residing in the US
and Africa.

While 9.4% of the providers in the training data have the "potential fraud"
label, 38% of the claims were submitted by these providers.  Even more
striking, 58% of the inpatient claims were submitted by "potential fraud"
providers.

             number_plot = FALSE)
```

</div>

## Scope {.unnumbered}

The hospital visits in the dataset occurred throughout 2009 and were mainly
limited to 2009.

Multiple clues in the dataset indicate that the hospital patients are Medicare
patients.  Medicare covers patients who are 65 or older, certain younger people
with disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease (permanent kidney
failure).

  - The first clue leading to this conclusion is that for nearly all of the
    inpatient visits, the deductible paid by the patient was $1068, the 2009
    deductible for an inpatient visit covered by Medicare.  (About 2% of the
    inpatient visits had NA for the deductible paid, but for all other
    inpatient visits the deductible paid was $1068.)
  - Consistent with the special treatment of end-stage renal disease by
    Medicare, the table of patient info includes a boolean feature
    RenalDiseaseIndicator.  This column is among other columns that identify a
    patient, such as birthdate, gender and race.
  - The column names NoOfMonths_PartACov, NoOfMonths_PartBCov in the table of
    patients can also be understood in this context:  these columns likely
    gives the number of months in 2009 the patient had coverage by Medicare
    Part A and Medicare Part B, respectively.  (Each of these columns contains
    integer values from 0 to 12.)

The patients appear to be residents of the US and Africa.

  - Each patient is identified with a state and a county, both labeled by
    integers (referred to here as codes).  There are 52 different state codes
    ranging from 1 to 54.  The county codes are three-digit integers ranging
    from 0 to 999.
  - The state and county codes appear to be components of 5-digit SSA
    (social-security administration) codes that identifies patient location.
    For example, the dataset includes 156 patients with state code 49 and
    county code 430, and these patients probably reside in Henrico County,
    Virginia (SSA code 49430).
  - Several consistency checks support this conclusion.  For example, nearly
    all of the <nobr>~ 3,000</nobr> combinations of state code and county code
    in the dataset correspond to locations specified by a 5-digit SSA code.
    Five US states (AK, CA, IL, NH, VA) in the dataset included county codes
    that I could not identify from the
    [SSA code data](https://www.nber.org/research/data/ssa-federal-information-processing-series-fips-state-and-county-crosswalk)
    published by the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/).
  - For simplicity, I will use "SSA state code" to refer to the first two
    digits of a 5-digit SSA code that identifies patient location.  Using this
    terminology, SSA state codes 1 to 53 correspond to the 50 US states,
    together with District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin
    Islands.  For example, state code 53 corresponds to Wyoming.
  - SSA state codes above 53 are also defined:  for instance, 54 and 55
    corresponds to Africa and Asia, respectively.
  - The SSA state codes in the dataset correspond to the 50 US states, together
    with the District of Columbia and Africa.

The number of healthcare providers in the dataset (including both training and
test data) is 6,763.  This is somewhat larger than the
[number of hospitals in the US in 2009](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185843/number-of-all-hospitals-in-the-us-since-2001/)
(5,795).

  - Is this apparent discrepancy due to the inclusion of Medicare patients
    living in Africa?  The number of providers in the dataset visited only by
    patients residing in Africa is 55, so this is probably not the explanation.
  - The 2009 count of US hospitals originated from the
    [American Hospital Association](https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals)
    (AHA).  Although the description of the healthcare-fraud dataset on Kaggle
    refers to "hospital visits," it may be that not all healthcare providers
    visited met the AHA definition of a hospital.

The dataset includes information for <nobr>~ 690,000</nobr> visits to a
hospital (or similar healthcare provider), including <nobr>~ 50,000</nobr>
inpatient visits and <nobr>~ 640,000</nobr> outpatient visits.  By way of
comparison, the
[number of inpatient hospital visits in the US in 2009 for which Medicare was the expected primary payer](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/factsandfigures/2009/pdfs/FF_report_2009.pdf)
was <nobr>~ 15 million</nobr>.

The number of patients in the dataset is <nobr>~ 150,000</nobr>, compared to
<nobr>~ 46 million</nobr> people
[enrolled for Medicare coverage in
2009](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/CMS-Statistics-Reference-Booklet/Downloads/CMS_Stats_2009.pdf).

Within the Medicare system, payments for doctor services are distinct from
payments to hospitals.  The dataset does not appear to include information
about payments to doctors.

  - For both inpatient and outpatient visits covered by Medicare,
    [patients pay 20%](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11435-Are-You-an-Inpatient-or-Outpatient.pdf)
    of the cost of doctor services.
  - In the dataset, the information about payments is contained in the
    features InscClaimAmtReimbursed and DeductibleAmtPaid.  Payments made by
    patients for doctor services are distinct from these two categories.
  - In principle the payments made by patients for doctor services could be
    lumped in with the feature DeductibleAmtPaid, but clearly this was not
    done for inpatient visits, since all claims have $1068 or NA for this
    feature.  (As noted above, $1068 is the 2009 deductible for an inpatient
    visit covered by Medicare.)
  - Note that a "potential fraud" label is given for providers but not for
    doctors.  This focus on provider fraud may explain the apparent lack of
    information in the dataset about payments for doctor services.

## Terminology {.unnumbered}

An outpatient hospital visit is often defined as a
[visit for which it is not necessary to stay overnight](https://www.pbmchealth.org/news-events/blog/difference-between-inpatient-and-outpatient-care)
at the hospital.

However, Medicare defines an outpatient as one who has not formally been
admitted to a hospital with a doctor's order.  A
[Medicare publication](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11435-Are-You-an-Inpatient-or-Outpatient.pdf)
explains that the decision to formally admit a patient is "a complex medical
decision," and even a stay of two or more nights at a hospital does not
guarantee that a patient will be an inpatient.

  - For example, staying overnight in connection with a visit to the emergency
    room would not necessarily be an inpatient visit.  Emergency-department
    services are outpatient services, as are observation services, which help a
    doctor decide whether a patient needs to be formally admitted.

The question of whether to formally admit a patient can be financially
significant for the patient, because inpatient and outpatient visits are
covered by different parts of the Medicare program (Part A and Part B,
respectively).

  - Medicare patients pay a one-time deductible for the set of inpatient visits
    made during a year.
  - However, in general a copayment must be made for each outpatient visit, and
    the set of copayments made by a patient during a year can add up to more
    that the one-time deductible for inpatient visits.  (In the table for
    outpatient visits, the feature DeductibleAmtPaid apparently gives patient
    copayments.)

## Data integrity {.unnumbered}

The dataset appears clean, and it passed several checks for consistency among
the data frames.

There is an apparent inconsistency in some outpatient visits:  the two
features that report payments for a visit (DeductibleAmtPaid,
InscClaimAmtReimbursed) are both equal to zero in some cases.

  - This is true for about 4% of the outpatient visits in the training data,
    for instance.
  - Does zero payment indicate that payment was refused because fraud was
    suspected?  Apparently not, because the fraction of zero-payment
    outpatient claims from providers labeled as "potential fraud" (36.1%) is
    quite close to the fraction for the full training set of outpatient visits
    (36.6%).
  - A possible explanation is that the dataset includes claims submitted to
    Medicare that were eventually covered by other insurers.
  - Another possibility is that in practice, hospitals receive zero payment
    for some outpatient visits, e.g., because the costs associated with
    collecting payment are too great to justify pursuing payment.

In most (or possibly all) cases, NA in the csv files can be viewed as an
artifact of the way in which the data is presented, rather than an indication
that a  valid data point is missing.

Columns with NA:

  1. The tables for inpatient and outpatient visits include a number of columns
     in which codes relevant for the visit can be reported.  For example, there
     are 10 columns ClmDiagnosisCode_1 through ClmDiagnosisCode_10 for claim
     diagnosis codes, and there are many NA in these columns.

      - Most NA in these columns can be viewed as an artifact of the table
        organization.
      - About 1.5% of outpatient visits (but no inpatient visits) in the
        dataset that have NA for all code columns.
      - Is it plausible that these outpatient Medicare claims had no codes when
        submitted, or is it more likely that the submitted codes are missing
        from the dataset?  Further research would be needed to answer this
        question.

   2. Similarly, three columns are reserved for physicians associated with the
      visit:  AttendingPhysician, OperatingPhysician, OtherPhysician.

      - Most NA in these columns can also be viewed as an artifact of the
        table organization.
      - There are 135 inpatient visits and 1688 outpatient visits with NA in
        all three of these columns.
      - Possible research questions:
        - Is an outpatient hospital visit necessarily associated with a
          physician?  For instance, a nurse practitioner may be able to fill
          in for a physician for certain outpatient visits.
        - Do certain combinations of codes tend to lack a physician?

  3. For about 2% of the inpatient visits (but not for any outpatient visits),
     DeductibleAmtPaid is NA.  As noted in the section on dataset scope, the
     deductible paid by inpatients was $1068 in all cases where it was not NA.

     - These NA probably correspond to visits for which the deductible payment
       was zero, because the patient had already paid the one-time deductible
       for the year.
     - However, there are samples that have NA for DeductibleAmtPaid with
       InscClaimAmtReimbursed equal to zero.  For instance, there are 25 rows
       of this sort in the training data.

# Analysis

## Chronic conditions {.tabset}

### Summary {.unnumbered}

Since the dataset appears to represent a set of visits covered by Medicare,
it is expected that the patients are mainly elderly and that many have chronic
health problems.  However, the frequency of some chronic conditions among
these patients is quite high, and most patients have multiple chronic
conditions.

<div class="code-block" style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;">

Chronic conditions are widespread even among the Medicare patients who are not
elderly.  In the plot below, the patients under the age of 65 are disabled or

## Reason for hospital visit

The data on hospital visits includes a column ClmAdmitDiagnosisCode that gives
the diagnosis at the time the patient was admitted.  This code can be roughly
identified as the reason for the hospital visit.

The top five reasons for inpatient visits:

  1. Chest pain
  2. Shortness of breath
  3. Pneumonia
  4. Congestive heart failure (insufficient blood flow)
  5. Syncope (fainting or "passing out")

The top five reasons for outpatient visits:

  1. Mammogram
  2. Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)
  3. High blood pressure
  4. Diabetes
  5. Monitoring of therapeutic drugs

## Fraud associations for patients and doctors {.tabset}

### Summary {.unnumbered}

For simplicity, providers that have the "potential fraud" label, as well as
claims submitted by these providers, will be labeled as "fraudulent" in the
remainder of the presentation.

The plots below show that for inpatient claims, both doctors and patients can
both be roughly classified into two groups:  those with no fraudulent claims
and those with only fraudulent claims.

  - For outpatient claims, the same pattern can be seen among doctors, but
    the pattern is less pronounced among patients.

The first plot below also shows, however, a small but still significant
fraction of inpatients has 50% fraudulent claims.

  - There may be distinct fraud methods associated with the different parts of
    the distributions shown in the tabbed subsections.

Note that the second plot below shows that in the category of inpatients
having only a single claim, the median percentage of fraudulent claims is
100%.  (About 57% of the inpatients with only a single claim are associated
with a fraudulent provider.)

<div class="summary-code-block">

```{r, patients-fraud-summary, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
    plot_fraud_per_individual(
        patients,

        individual_type = 'patient',
        claim_type = 'inpatient',
        include_counts = FALSE
    )
```

</div>

The rough separation of doctors into two groups can also be seen in the
scatter plot below.  Doctors with a sufficiently large number of claims are
exclusively in the "only fraudulent claims" group.

<div class="summary-code-block">

```{r, doctors-fraud-summary, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

Note that for bar charts in which the number of claims per doctor is shown on

plots of fraudulent claims per doctor vs total claims per doctor.

## Provider claim counts {.tabset}

There is a strong association between fraud and the number of claims submitted
by a provider.

The plot below illustrates this association for inpatient claims.  In this
dataset, only fraudulent providers submit more than about 100 inpatient
claims.

The cost of hospital visits doesn't show a strong association with fraud.

patient's percentage of fraudulent claims shows a symmetric pattern.  This
association is potentially significant, although it is difficult to interpret.

## Visit / claim duration

### Inpatient visit duration {.tabset .unnumbered}

#### Summary {.unnumbered}

"Inpatient visit duration" is used here to mean the time between an
inpatient's admission and discharge dates.

Plots in the tabbed subsections show that inpatient visit duration is affected
by patient age and by the number of chronic conditions a patient has.  But
there isn't a strong association between fraud and visit duration.

#### Distribution {.unnumbered}

The 36-day upper bound on visit durations is striking.  I didn't find any
indication that 36 days is a significant threshold for inpatient visits
covered by Medicare.

  - This may be an artifact of the (unknown) process by which data was
    selected for inclusion in the dataset.  However, further research into
    this question could also be worthwhile.

### Claim duration {.tabset .unnumbered}

#### Summary {.unnumbered}

As discussed in the tabbed subsection *Terminology* of Sec. 2 above, patients
can stay at a hospital for multiple nights without being formally admitted as
an inpatient.

The "claim duration", given by (ClaimEndDt - ClaimStartDt), appears to be
the duration of the patient's stay in the hospital, including any period
in which the patient was not formally admitted as an inpatient.

  - For most inpatient claims, the claim duration is identical to the visit
    duration.
  - The mean claim duration for outpatients is 2.4 days.

Similarly to visit duration, claim duration does not have a strong association
with fraud.

The distribution of visit cost per day is nearly identical for fraudulent and
legitimate claims, as illustrated in the plots below.

  - The underlying structure responsible for this similarity may be
    widespread duplication of legitimate claims.

<div class="summary-code-block">

```{r, claim-duration-summary, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
    to_plot <- claims$outpatient %>%
        filter(visit_cost != 0) %>%
        select(PotentialFraud, claim_duration, cost_per_claim_day)
    plot_cost_per_day(to_plot, variable_name = 'cost_per_claim_day',
                      claim_type = 'outpatient', duration_label = 'claim')
```

</div>

#### Distribution {.unnumbered}

Note that for both inpatient and outpatient visits, the claims with maximum
value of claim duration are all fraudulent.  Close inspection of the plots,
however, shows that these "all fraud" bars correspond to a very small number
of claims.

  - For example, there are a significant number of inpatient visits with
    claim duration of 36 days.  But the bar showing 100% fraud is for claim
    duration of 37 days, which includes just 2 inpatient claims.

<div class="tab-display">

## Duplicated claims {.tabset}

### Summary {.unnumbered}

It is natural to suspect that fraudulent claims are duplicates of legitimate
claims in some sense, particularly given that the distribution of cost per day
for fraudulent and legitimate claims is essentially identical.

This section explores the possibility that an important method of duplication
is to copy all diagnosis and procedure codes associated with a claim.

The first plot below shows that only a tiny fraction of inpatient claims are
duplicated in this way, so further research is needed into methods used to
duplicate claims.

<div class="summary-code-block">

```{r, duplicate-summary-1, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
fig_base <- filter_out_no_codes(claims$inpatient) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(identical_claim_count - 1))) +
    xlab('Number of duplicate claims submitted') +
    ggtitle('Number of duplicates submitted for inpatients')
plot_bar_charts(fig_base, y_label = 'claims', percent_plot = FALSE)
```

</div>

Even though only a small number of inpatient claims are duplicated in this way,
analysis of identical groups of claims reveals a category containing only
fraudulent claims.

<div class="summary-code-block">

```{r, duplicate-summary-2, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
title <- 'Number of claims per provider in identical groups, inpatients'
fig_base <- filter_out_no_codes(inpatient_claims) %>%

## Time series {.tabset}

### Weekly visit count {.unnumbered}

From the plot of weekly inpatient visits, it appears that the first and last
weekly dates with complete data may be 2008-12-29, 2009-12-21, respectively.

For the outpatient data, the period in which weekly data appears complete is
2009-01-05 to 2009-12-21.

Outside of these ranges, it's possible that the data is incomplete, and so the
time-series decompositions will include only the data in these ranges.

### By initial diagnosis {.unnumbered}

Does the weekly seasonality depend on the reason for a hospital visit (as
determined by the initial diagnosis code)?

It is tempting to interpret the weekly seasonalities shown below as
meaningful, but the variation during the week is quite small, and the number
of samples is much smaller than for the full sets of inpatient or outpatient
claims.  Further analysis would be needed to determine whether these
apparent seasonalities are just random noise.

# Conclusion: fraud associations

The strongest predictor of fraud in the dataset is the number of claims
submitted by a provider.  The fraudulent providers, which represent a
relatively small percentage of the total, are responsible for a substantial
percentage of claims submitted.

For inpatient claims, both doctors and patients can both be roughly classified
into two groups:  those with no fraudulent claims and those with only
fraudulent claims.

  - For outpatient claims, the same pattern can be seen among doctors, but
    the pattern is less pronounced among patients.

In addition to this broad generalization, the analysis shows some subtler
patterns in fraud associations involving patients.

  - These patterns, which may be associated with distinct methods of fraud,
    could be a guide in designing machine-learning methods of detecting fraud.

Duplication of claims is a promising area for further investigation.

  - The fact that the distribution of cost per day is essentially identical
    for fraudulent and legitimate claims suggest that some form of claim
    duplication may be widespread.
  - A central question is which details of a claims are duplicated and which
    are varied by fraudulent providers that generate a large number of claims.
